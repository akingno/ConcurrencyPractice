# ConcurrencyPractice

<p> This is my practice of concurrency based on C++

TODO: 
1.Use packaged_task to package the function, get the result asynchronously
2.Consider add Terminate to terminate the threads, ignore the results
3.Improving the code style
4.Rm redundunt prints and add comments
5.Try to rm some bools because I found there's more than I expected
