# ConcurrencyPractice

<p> This is my practice of concurrency based on C++

### TODO:
 
<br>1.Use packaged_task to package the function, get the result asynchronously
<br>2.Consider add Terminate to terminate the threads, ignore the results
<br>3.Improving the code style
<br>4.Rm redundunt prints and add comments
<br>5.Try to rm some bools because I found there's more than I expected
